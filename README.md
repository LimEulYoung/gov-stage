# Gov-STAGE

## 1. Overview
Gov-STAGE is a powerful system designed to help enterprises and public institutions securely utilize Large Language Models (LLM) while ensuring personal data protection. Our solution integrates a Personal Data Identification and Re-identification system that prevents sensitive data from being exposed to external threats during the use of AI-powered services.

Key Features:
- **Private LLM Integration**: A dedicated, fine-tuned Private LLM, based on the Solar Mini model, is deployed locally to handle the detection and anonymization of personal information.
- **Secure Public LLM Queries**: Once the data is anonymized, it is safely transmitted to Public LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude, ensuring the sensitive information is never compromised.
- **Re-identification and Data Restoration**: If necessary, responses from Public LLMs can be re-identified using the internal Private LLM within the organization, making the process seamless and secure.

Gov-STAGE enables public institutions and enterprises to embrace advanced AI technologies without compromising on data privacy and compliance with global data protection regulations such as GDPR and local privacy laws.

In this example:
- Personal information such as names, addresses, and dates are automatically anonymized before being sent to an Public LLM.
- The right-side menu shows the customizable list of personal data types that can be anonymized based on your requirements.
- Once the response is generated, re-identification is applied where needed, restoring the necessary information while keeping other data anonymized.
